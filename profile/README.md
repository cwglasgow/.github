Cage Warriors 187: Glasgow will take over Braehead Arena with a night of elite talent and electrifying action. Don‚Äôt miss the next generation of Scottish MMA stars as they look to follow in the footsteps of local heroes like Paul McVeigh and Joanne Wood.

Few prospects on the CW roster have been talked up the way Paisley‚Äôs 22-year-old prodigy Sean Clancy Jr has, and with good reason. The Higher Level man has wowed fans, opponents and industry insiders alike with his rapid development, all but cruising his way to a spotless 5-0 professional record.

The Scotsman is a specimen, boasting a physique that would make fitness models turn green with envy. And with Clancy, it‚Äôs not window-dressing; he‚Äôs all functional strength and fast-twitch muscle-fibres.

His physical gifts, as finely honed as they are, are only half the story though. The toolkit he‚Äôs developed under Coach James Doolan is looking more than formidable for a fighter of his age.
